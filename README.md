Authors: Ellie DeCarlo, Miranda Law

This blog aims to provide information about the effect of mental illness and its prevalence globally. The blog address questions about country, continent, age, and gender, and how each of these factors can play in to the proportion of people suffering with mental illness. The goal is to show which groups of people, specifically by country, age, and gender, are at the highest risk of mental illness to find which groups need the most support from those who are able to help. The data used within this blog is from the [Our World in Data website](https://ourworldindata.org/), and includes mental health information from 1990 to 2019.
